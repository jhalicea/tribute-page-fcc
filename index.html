            <u>

                    <strong>1963</strong> - Thich returned to Vietnam to aid his fellow monks in their non-violent 
                    peace efforts during the Vietnam War.

                <li><strong>1965</strong> - Thich writes a letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. entitled: "In Search of the Enemy of Man".</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1966</strong> - Thich again moves to the US to lead a symposium in Vietnamese Buddhism 
                    at Cornell University, and to continue his work for peace. It was during his 1966 stay in the US 
                    that Nhat Hanh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1966</strong> - Thich Nhat Hanh left Vietnam for what he thought would be a few short weeks.

                    <strong>1967</strong> - Dr. King nominates Thich Nhat Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize. 
                    The fact that King had revealed the candidate he had chosen to nominate and had made 
                    a "strong request" to the prize committee, was in sharp violation of the Nobel traditions and protocol.

                <li>
                    <strong>2018</strong> - A press release from the Plum Village community confirmed that Nhat Hạnh, 
                    now aged 92, had returned to Vietnam a final time and will reside at Tu Hieu Temple to "live his remaining days".
